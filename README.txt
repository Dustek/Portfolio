# Personal Portfolio

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to create my own personal portfolio that showcases my work as a developer. I plan to use it through my career, inserting new projects as I complete them.

## Background

Creating a portfolio that showcases your past projects as a web developer is important, as it showcases your abilities to  potential future employers. 

## Usage

The portfolio consists of a single page, with 3 main sections - "About me", "Example work" and "Contact me". The header contains clickable navigation buttons that bring you to each section.
The "Example work" section contains clickable boxes that open projects in new windwos. Please note, only 2 projects are completed thus far, and the other images will be changed to display
future projects as I complete them. 

The "Contact me" section also contains interactive links to my personal e-mail, phone number, GitHub and LinkedIn

## Creation Process

The main content of the website is  structured in a grid with 2 columns and 3 rows. The smaller left column contains the title of the column and the right column contains the content.
Within the "Example work" section, the images are laid out using display flex, with one big image and 4 smaller ones. Styling is applied throughout the web page to make it better structured and appealing.
I have also used media querries to make the web page responsive to resizing and different devices; the grid structure changes to a single column and the various elements throught the
web page resize and get moved around to accomodate shrinking the screen.

## Acknowledgements

I would like to give credit to my instructor, Abdul, as well as all the TA's and fellow students who have helped me learn how to complete this project.
